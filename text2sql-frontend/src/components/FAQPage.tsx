            answer:
                "Our query flow currently runs everything locally on your machine. Any stored data (conversations, messages, etc.) is stored on your machine in SQLite. No servers, no cloud, no risk of leaks. We don't even own a server, this site is statically hosted ðŸ™‚",
        },
        {
            question: "How do you query my data sources?",
            answer: "Since everything is local, we connect to your data sources (files, databases, etc.) locally. Most secure way of transmitting data is not transmitting any ðŸ˜Ž. This also makes you responsible for providing us with a secure connection to your data, giving you maximum control over everything ðŸ”¥"
        },
        {
            question: "Does the LLM see my data?",
            answer: "Nope, not by default! Let's say we executed SQL, fetched a bunch of rows. The LLM only has access to descriptions of your data, including table names, column names, and their types. You can choose to let the LLM see sample rows + results if you choose however, not everyone has sensitive data."
