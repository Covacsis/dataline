# DataLine

## Getting started

Homebrew

```bash
brew tap ramiawar/dataline

brew install dataline
```

DataLine should then be running on port 5173 accessible from your browser: http://localhost:5173

Running manually: check backend and frontend folders.

### Startup Quest

Go through the following checklist to explore DataLine's features!
- [ ] Create a sample database connection
- [ ] Create a new chat and rename it
- [ ] Start asking questions about your data and getting answers
- [ ] Refresh the page and re-run some SQL queries
- [ ] Click inside an SQL query, modify it, and save your modification for later!
- [ ] Try to modify your sample DB connection and explore the connection editor page
- [ ] Try asking for a chart!
- [ ] To really challenge it, ask a question that is answered with multiple results (charts, tables, etc.)
- [ ] Add a profile picture
